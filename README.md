# 📌 EmpAttrition

## 🔍 What is Attrition?
Attrition refers to the gradual reduction in the number of employees, customers, or other individuals in a group over time. It occurs naturally due to various reasons, such as resignation, retirement, or disengagement.

### 🏢 Employee Attrition
Employee attrition happens when employees leave an organization due to resignation, retirement, or layoffs, and the company does not immediately replace them.

## ⚠️ How Can Employee Attrition Impact a Company?
A decline in the workforce can lead to several negative consequences, such as:

- **💰 Increased Hiring & Training Costs** – Replacing employees requires recruitment, onboarding, and training, which can be expensive and time-consuming.
- **📉 Loss of Knowledge & Expertise** – When experienced employees leave, they take valuable skills and institutional knowledge with them, potentially affecting productivity and decision-making.
- **😟 Lower Employee Morale** – High attrition can create uncertainty and stress among remaining employees, leading to disengagement and lower motivation.
- **🚀 Decreased Productivity** – Frequent employee turnover can disrupt workflows, causing delays and inefficiencies.
